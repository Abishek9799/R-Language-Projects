# Introduction

Replicating the following graph [NYT Graphic](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html?_r=0&ref=baseball) using the core R `graphics` package.

# Lahman Data

These baseball data come from the `Lahman` package, which contains `Teams` - 
seasonal stats for each team.

<br>

```{r}

library(Lahman) 
data(Teams)                               # Load 'Teams' dataset

```

<br>

## Previewing Teams Data

We can view the first few rows of `Teams` with function `head()`.

<br>

```{r}

head(Teams)

```

<br>

## Preprocessing

Summary statistics required for this graphic are calculated as follows. 

**Note:** *The years in the dataset exceed the years shown in the NYT graphic and require filtering or plotting limits.*

<br>

```{r}

ave.so <- Teams$SO / Teams$G                      # Calculating average strikeouts per game
year <- Teams$yearID                              # Extracting a vector of years per team

ave.so.min <- min(ave.so, na.rm = TRUE)
ave.so.max <- max(ave.so, na.rm = TRUE)           # Minimum and maximum x-axis limits

league.ave <- tapply(X = ave.so, 
                     INDEX = as.factor(year), 
                     FUN = "mean", 
                     na.rm = TRUE)                # Calculating league strikeout average/season

league.year <- as.numeric(names(league.ave))      # Ensuring years are numeric, not text
 
index<- which(year >=1900 & year <=2012)
year<- year[index]
ave.so <-ave.so[index]

index<- which(league.year >=1900 & league.year <=2012)
league.year<- league.year[index]
league.ave <-league.ave[index]
```

<br>
<br>

# Replication

The following recreates the NYT graphic as closely as possible.


<br>

## 1. Average Strike-Outs by Year

The following establishes plot dimensions and specifies x- and y-axis variables. 

```{r}

plot.new()

plot.window(xlim = c(1900, 2012), 
            ylim = c(ave.so.min, 
                     ave.so.max))   # Specify dimensions

points(x = year, 
       y = ave.so)                  # Create scatterplot


```

<br>
<br>

## 2. Point Color, Size, & Shape

The following additional code builds on the previous plot to specify point color, size, and shape.

```{r}

plot.new()

plot.window(xlim = c(1900, 2012),   # Specify x-axis limits 
            ylim = c(ave.so.min, 
                     ave.so.max))   # Specify y-axis limits

points(x = year, 
       y = ave.so,
       col = "gray85",              # Color
       pch = 16,                    # Shape
       cex = 0.75)                  # Size


```

<br>
<br>

## 3. Full Replication

The following code replicates the NYT graphic in its entirety.


```{r}

# Your code here
